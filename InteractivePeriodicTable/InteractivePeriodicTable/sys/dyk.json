(You can solidify it at extremely high pressure and low temperature.)"},{"fact": "You can't taste food without saliva."},{"fact": "Fish scales are a common lipstick ingredient."},{"fact": "Some lipstick contains lead acetate or sugar of lead. This toxic lead compound makes the lipstick taste sweet."},{"fact": "The average shot of espresso contains less caffeine than a typical cup of coffee."},{"fact": "Coca Cola originally contained cocaine."},{"fact": "Lemons contain more sugar than strawberries, for the same mass."},{"fact": "Lobster blood is colorless until it is exposed to air. Then the blood appears blue."},{"fact": "Goldfish eyes perceive not only the visible spectrum, but also infrared and ultraviolet light."},{"fact": "When you freeze saltwater or seawater slowly, you get freshwater ice. Icebergs are freshwater, too, although that is because they come from glaciers, which are made from freshwater (snow)."},{"fact": "Urh je jak."},{"fact": "If you exposed a glass of water to space, it would boil rather than freeze. However, the water vapor would crystallize into ice afterward."},{"fact": " Fresh egg will sink in fresh water. A stale egg will float."},{"fact": "The wallpaper in Napoleon's room was dyed with Scheele’s Green, which contains copper arsenide. In 1893 the Italian biochemist Gosio found that dampening wallpaper containing Scheele’s Green allowed a mold to convert the copper arsenide into poisonous arsenic vapor. Although this may not have been the cause of Napoleon's death, it certainly can't have helped his health!"},{"fact": "Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air. Of course, it doesn't travel through a vacuum at all."},{"fact": "About 78% of the average human brain consists of water."},{"fact": "Macadamia nuts are toxic dogs."},{"fact": " A lightning strike can reach a temperature of 30,000 degrees Celsius or 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit."},{"fact": "Fire typically spreads uphill more quickly than downhill. This is because temperature affects the rate of combustion. The region above a fire tends to be much hotter than the area below it, plus it may have a better supply of fresh air."},{"fact": "Frogs don't need to drink water since they can absorb it through their skin. Humans, on the other hand, have waterproofing proteins in their skin to help prevent water loss."},{"fact": "The hardest chemical in your body is your tooth enamel."},{"fact": "Urine fluoresces or glows under ultraviolet light."},{"fact": "Pearls, bones and teeth will dissolve in vinegar, which contains weak acetic acid."},{"fact": "The chemical name for water is dihydrogen monoxide."},{"fact": "You can extend the life of rubberbands by storing them in the refrigerator."},{"fact": "The ethylene gas produced by a ripening apple ripens other apples as well as many other types of produce."},{"fact": "Water expands about 9% when it freezes into ice."},{"fact": "Mars is red because its surface contains a lot of iron oxide or rust."},{"fact": "You've lost about 1% of your body's water by the time you feel thirsty."},{"fact": "You have chemoreceptors or taste buds on the inside of your cheek as well as on your tongue."},{"fact": "The only elements that are liquid at room temperature are bromine and mercury. However, you can melt gallium by holding a lump in the warmth of your hand."},{"fact": "Unlike many substances, water expands as it freezes. An ice cube takes up about 9% more volume than the water used to make it."},{"fact": "If you pour a handful of salt into a full glass of water, the water level will actually go down rather than overflowing the glass."},{"fact": "There is about 1/2 lb or 250 g of salt (NaCl) in the average adult human body."},{"fact": "A pure element can take many forms. For example, diamond and graphite both are forms of pure carbon."},{"fact": "The chemical name for water (H2O) is dihydrogen monoxide."},{"fact": "The only letter that doesn't appear on the periodic table is J."},{"fact": "Lightning strikes produce O3, which is ozone, and strengthen the ozone layer of the atmosphere."},{"fact": "The only two non-silvery metals are gold and copper."},{"fact": "Although oxygen gas is colorless, the liquid and solid forms of oxygen are blue."},{"fact": "The human body contains enough carbon to provide 'lead' (which is really graphite) for about 9,000 pencils."},{"fact": "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, while oxygen is the most abundant element in the earth's atmosphere, crust, and oceans (about 49.5%)."},{"fact": "The rarest naturally-occurring element in the earth's crust may be astatine. The entire crust appears to contain about 28 g of the element."},{"fact": "Hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will dissolve glass. Although it is corrosive, hydrofluoric acid is considered to be a 'weak acid'."},{"fact": "One bucket full of water contains more atoms than there are bucketfuls of water in the Atlantic ocean."},{"fact": "Approximately 20% of the oxygen in the atmosphere was produced by the Amazon rainforest."},{"fact": "Helium balloons float because helium is lighter than air."},{"fact": "Bee stings are acidic while wasp stings are alkaline."},{"fact": "Hot peppers get their heat from a molecule called capsaicin. While the molecule acts as an irritant to mammals, including humans, birds lack the receptor responsible for the effect and are immune to the burning sensation from exposure."},{"fact": "Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide, CO2."},{"fact": "Liquid air has a bluish tint, similar to water."}
